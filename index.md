# This is a big header
## This is a smaller header
### This is smaller still
#### I think this is the smallest header!

I can also write just plain old text!

This is an ordered list of objects:
1. this is thing number 1
2. this is thing number 2
3. and this is the last thing

I can also do unordered lists!
* thing 1
  * this is a sub-thing
* thing 2
* thing 3
